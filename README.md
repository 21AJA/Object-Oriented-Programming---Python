# Object-Oriented-Programming---Python
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python uses objects and classes to create modular, reusable code. Key principles include Encapsulation (bundling data and methods), Inheritance (reusing code through class hierarchies), Polymorphism (interchangeable methods), and Abstraction (hiding complexities). OOP enhances maintainability and scalability.
